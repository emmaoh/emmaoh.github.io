					<p> 
							I am currently a Grade 12 student at R.E. Mountain Secondary School! I plan to attend UBC starting Fall 2020 for General Sciences.<br/><br/>

							


							

					     My hobbies include playing tennis, adventuring with my friends, travelling with my family, watching movies, being outdoors, playing sports and many more.   <br/><br/>

						 Throughout my whole life, my dad took photos everywhere we went and of my family for us to keep, and even to this day, 
						 my dad, brother and I love to take photos of wherever we go together. Growing up looking back at photos, whether they're from before I was even born to now, I percieve photos to be a way to travel back in time to
						 wherever I want to go within all of my cherishing memories throughout not only my life, but my family's as well. <br/><br/>
